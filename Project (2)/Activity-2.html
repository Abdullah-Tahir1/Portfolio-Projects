        <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On June 6, 1944, United States Army Private First Class Ronald "Red" Daniels of the 1st Infantry Division takes part in the storming of Normandy Beach with his squad, consisting of: Private First Class Robert Zussman, who is his best friend, Private Drew Stiles, Technician Fifth Grade Frank Aiello, Technical Sergeant William Pierson and First Lieutenant Joseph Turner. During the operation, Zussman is stabbed, keeping him on the sideline. <br> <br></summary>
            <details> <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zussman returns to duty to partake in Operation Cobra, where the Allied forces successfully push to reclaim the town of Marigny. The squad is ordered by Colonel Davis to conduct a joint operation with Special Operations Executive British officers Major Arthur Crowley and Vivian to intercept a German train carrying V2 rockets, near Argentan. Daniels and Zussman derail the train, before being escorted back to their squad by a French Resistance leader named Rousseau. <br> <br>            </summary>
                <details><summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A week later, Rousseau and Crowley infiltrate a German garrison in Paris to retrieve explosives, in preparation of the squad's assault on the garrison. Midway, Rousseau kills SS-und Polizeiführer Heinrich, in retaliation for killing her family. The squad then successfully liberates Paris. <br> <br>                </summary>
                    <details><summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two months later, the squad takes over a German-occupied hotel in the city of Aachen. They discover civilians inside the hotel, and Turner orders their evacuation, to Pierson's dismay. A young girl named Anna goes missing, and Daniels searches for her. German soldiers open fire on a truck carrying the civilians, killing Anna's older sister. Pierson sends the truck away without protection, creating a rift with Turner. <br> <br>                    </summary>
                        <details><summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the platoon is ordered to take Hill 493. Turner splits the platoon into two groups; Pierson and Zussman are tasked with advancing towards the hill, while Turner and Daniels cover them until they can meet at the bottom. Turner's squad soon receives a transmission revealing that Pierson ordered an attack on the hill against Turner's orders. The platoon destroys an artillery position but the Germans counter-attack with a Tiger II tank. Daniels is knocked out trying to disable the tank, which is destroyed by tank commander Staff Sergeant Augustine Pérez. Turner is fatally wounded rescuing Daniels, and orders Daniels to abandon him while he covers the platoon's escape. Pierson becomes head of the platoon and makes Daniels his second-in-command, promoting him to Corporal. <br> <br>                        </summary>
                            <details><summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the height of the Battle of the Bulge, the platoon is surrounded by Germans. Daniels meets an African-American technician, Howard, who helps the platoon contact air support. The platoon captures several German soldiers and discovering that the Germans were ordered to destroy a bridge at Remagen, the last bridge over the Rhine. After destroying the explosives in transit, Pierson orders the platoon to attack a nearby air base to destroy the remaining explosives. The attack fails, resulting in Daniels and Zussman surrounded by enemy troops. Daniels is saved by Howard, while Zussman is captured and taken to a German POW camp, Stalag IX-B. In Stalag IX-B, Zussman is interrogated on his Jewish heritage by SS officer Metz, then beaten and sent to a POW labor camp. Daniels is hospitalized due to his wounds. <br> <br>                            </summary>
                                <details><summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the hospital, Daniels learns from Davis about the events that changed Pierson in the Battle of Kasserine Pass. After recovering, Daniels confronts Pierson in his tent and tears up his honorable discharge papers in order to rejoin the platoon. They successfully capture the last bridge over the Rhine. The platoon heads into Germany, liberating concentration camps in search for Zussman, eventually reaching the Berga labor camp, which they find abandoned. The camp's survivors were sent on a death march. Daniels finds and saves Zussman by killing Metz before he can execute him. <br> <br>                                </summary>
                                     <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the war, Daniels parts ways with his platoon and returns to Texas, reuniting with his wife and newborn son. Daniels names his son Joseph Turner to honor the late lieutenant. He visits the grave of his older brother, Paul, who died fighting a wolf when Red was a kid. He places his Bronze Star medal on the grave, saying that his brother deserves it for teaching him to shoot.</p>                                    </summary>

            <summary><em><u>Overview:</u></em> Call of Duty: WWII returns to the gameplay often featured in the older Call of Duty games, featuring the standard grounded movement. It also features similar server support to that of previous games. However, unlike previous iterations, the game now features a special social place, the Headquarters section with the ability for the player to reside in between games. A special new game mode has also been added to the multiplayer which takes players on a simulated battle with objectives designed in an attack/defense style mode, called War. <br><br></summary>
                <details><summary><em><u>Divisions: </u></em> When the player first launches the multiplayer in Call of Duty: WWII, the player will enlist their soldier in one of five Divisions, Infantry, Airborne, Armored, Mountain and Expeditionary respectively. Each of the divisions is attuned to a specific weapon category or loadout preference but can be changed freely throughout the game. Divisions are not locked to certain weapon categories, however and the player can benefit from all but the first perk of each Division if they decide to use a weapon outside of the Division's category. <br><br></summary>
                    <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the player uses their Division, they will level up their Division and gain extra perks for their Division. The first perk of each Division, however, is restricted to the respective weapon class of that Division. Divisions are able to be prestiged after reaching level 4 with the respective division. The rewards for prestiging a division range from a new weapon (SVT-40, MP-40, MG 42, Kar98k and the Sawed-off Shotgun respectively), to Calling Cards, Uniforms and finally, a Weapon Variant for the respective division weapon.</summary>

You and your crew have arrived at a seemingly abandoned German village well behind enemy lines. Here, you'll face rampaging monsters, an infinite supply of bloodthirsty zombies, and darker experiments capable of nothing but murder. There is never enough time, nowhere near enough ammunition, and virtually no chance to escape. <br><br></summary>
                     <details> <summary><em><u>Plot: </u></em> German engineer Marie Fischer is sent on a mission to her hometown village of Mittelburg, Bavaria by her commanding officer, Major Rideau, to retrieve lost artifacts stolen by the Nazis for experimentation, as well as rescue her brother, Klaus, who provided the information. Klaus has been unwillingly working with their lead scientist Peter Straub and weapons expert Colonel Heinz Richter on a project to exploit a new energy dubbed "Geistkraft" to assist the Nazi party's war efforts. Marie is accompanied by ex-art thief Drostan Hynd, French Resistance fighter Olivia Durant and military captain Jefferson Potts, all of whom have significant knowledge on the stolen arts. However, on their train ride to Mittelburg, the group is attacked by an unidentified colossal being. Marie is stranded from the others, and finds herself taking temporary refuge at a small house nearby, where she holds out against hordes of dead German soldiers reanimated by Geistkraft, until she is able to make her way to the village. <br><br></summary>
                        <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After reuniting with the other three, Marie and the group proceed further down into the village, and inside Straub's lab. There, they fend off against Straub's undead horde, as well as Richter, whose obsession on weaponization of Geistkraft puts him at odds with Straub. Eventually, the group recovers the artifact, the hilt of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's Sword. They then encounter the creature from earlier, a humanoid-shaped amalgam of numerous body parts sewn and stitched together, dubbed the Panzermörder, with Klaus fused into the creature's chest. Using special magnetized batteries, the group manages to stun the Panzermörder and attach the batteries onto it, causing it to be attracted to Richter's zeppelin flying above the village. The zeppelin explodes, killing the Panzermörder and freeing Klaus from its body. The hilt's power somehow revives Klaus, causing him to be possessed by an unknown force. Klaus staggers into the village, telling Marie and the group to continue fighting, and that the Emperor must not return, before activating a fire trap, engulfing himself in flames.</summary>

                    <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call of Duty: WWII is so damn big that I'd be surprised if I didn't like something it has to offer. It's a series that blueprinted the feel and responsiveness of modern first-person shooters. I've always enjoyed the series' sugary pace and instant gratification, but too often the ideas wrapped around the signature shooting just don't work. WWII would be one of the better games in the series if I were judging purely based on its competitive multiplayer, but the Nazi Zombies mode is an awkward, obtuse grind, and the campaign fails to introduce many new ideas to Call of Duty at all. <br> <br></summary>
                         <details><summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The singleplayer campaign isn't really about WWII anyway, it's about how friendship between adult men requires both great sacrifice and a great aim. It turns a global catastrophe into a melodramatic test of camaraderie, more concerned with making you feel cool than bogging anyone down with historical context. I'm not surprised; Call of Duty always flubs the grandiose promises made by its marketing. This isn't the powerful history lesson for future generations it was first billed as. This is another Call of Duty campaign, replete with slow crawl concussion scenes, cornfed soldiers, and angry COs. <br> <br></summary>
                            <summary>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You play as Daniels, a US soldier and member of the 1st Infantry Division. Starting with the iconic and obligatory landing at Normandy, you shoot your way through the Western Front, liberating Paris, crossing the Rhine, and taking part in the Battle of the Bulge. To my surprise, it wraps with one of the quieter (still loud) endings I've seen in a Call of Duty game. Things are different in the return to 1940s Europe, but by small degrees. <em><u><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-wwii-review/" target="blank">Read the full review here</a></u></em> <br> <br></summary>
